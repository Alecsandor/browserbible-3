# BrowserBible 5.0 alpha

Open, flexible Bible software that runs in the browser.

## 5.0 Updates and Goals

* Standardize on ES6 classes (instead of module pattern and singletons)
* Update CSS to use Flexbox (or Grid) to reduce the need for absolute positioning and resizing
* Remove jQuery and use Zepto (future: possibly move to another framework)
* Simplify window and plugin structure to enable others to build new tools
* Change to USFM from DBS codes	

## Building Texts and Deploying

The text building tools are being moved to a separate repo.
